As more individuals are diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the demand for hemodialysis treatments and associated disposable products such as dialyzers, bloodlines, and needles is escalating. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as improved biocompatible materials for dialysis membranes, contribute to the enhanced effectiveness and comfort of treatments, boosting the adoption of these products across healthcare settings in North America.</p><p>Another key trend propelling the market is the rising adoption of home-based dialysis.
